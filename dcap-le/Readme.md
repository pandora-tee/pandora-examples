# Intel Data Center Attestation Primitives (DCAP)

This is a core enclave in the Intel DCAP windows driver that is derived from the vulnerable Linux selftest enclave. This example is [taken from this DCAP version](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/tree/4cb5c8b81f126f9aa3ee921d7980a909a9bd676d/driver/win/PLE).
