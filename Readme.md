# Pandora examples

This repository contains example enclaves that can be validated with Pandora. Check the latest release (or click on the DOI badge above to go to Zenodo) to directly download the binaries.

Note that this repository only contains the open-source examples that we are allowed to publish due to their licensing (i.e., not all enclave runtimes from the paper can be put here).

## List of examples

```
 - Intel DCAP: Driver enclave derived from Linux selftest enclave
 - Inclavare: Skeleton enclave derived from Linux selftest enclave
 - Intel SDK: Example enclave that can be compiled for multiple Intel SDK versions
 - Linux selftest: Test enclave that was never intended to be secure (as it is just for testing)
 - Open Enclave: Example enclave that can be compiled for multiple OpenEnclave versions
 - Pandora selftest: Varying levels of sanitizations applied to the Linux selftest enclave to test Pandora
```
